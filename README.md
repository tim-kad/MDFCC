File to run is **fp_gui.py** (not main.py).

The following packages are required:

  - **ambiance**
  - **geojson**
  - **geographiclib**
  - **spherical_geometry** - for building sectoral footprints (not required before that)
  - **geopandas** - for building sectoral footprints against specific countries

The following two are recommended, but not required (the program will work normally even if these are not installed): 

  - **tktooltips**
  - **playsound**
